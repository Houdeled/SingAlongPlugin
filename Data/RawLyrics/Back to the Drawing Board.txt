Red-faced, caught red-handed, paint-in-hand she paints the town red
Blue skies, sky's the limit, limit breakin', got the green light
Green-eyed, she's a monster. Silver bullet, silver linings
Lines, without the lines. Lines, without the lines. Now, make me, color me
Sage, scarlet, teal, tawny, pink, plum, bone, burgundy, bronze
Slate, salmon, smoke, sanguine, grey, goldenrod, lime, olive, and blonde
Now we comе to orange
Gotta rhyme something with orangе
'Cept that nothing rhymes with orange
Think that I'll just forget 'bout orange, so
Suck it up, brush it off, break it down, here we go
Getting' back to that drawing board
Tear it up, scrub it off, take it down, gotta go
Get on back to that drawing board
Fold 'em up, shrug it off, whoa. Let it go
Rub it on, wet paint, war paint, get it
Pick it up, takin' too slow. Time to go
Hey yo, why aren't you ready?
One, two, three, four
She'll give you to the count of four, then
Five, six, seven
She'll keep on counting up to seven
Eight, nine, ten, nine, eight, seven
Take it right back down to seven
Wait! How? Wait! What? No!
Time, outta time, now she's drawin' the line
Girls, what is she made of?
Sugar, spice, and
Oooh, none of them tails, love
She's everything
Nice! And if you're askin' her name (what?)
I will tell you her name (what?)
My Sugar Riot! Riot!
Ring-a-roses
Palette full of pain and poison
On your toes, yeah
Keepin' you guessin'. What?
Ring-a-roses
Heart is skippin', mind is trippin'
Round and around and around, yo
Round and around and around until you're down
We all fall down
Round and round and round
We all fall down
Round and round and round
We all fall down
Round and round and
Ashes to ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes to ashes
On the wall
The writing's on the wall, yo
She's off the wall, yo
This kid is off the wall, yo
Paint a picture
We're gonna paint you a picture
Truth straight from fiction
And this is what we'll start with
Think you can win this war
You're takin' her threats lightly
Put down them sticks, them swords
Her pen is far more mighty
Avant-garde, throw up your guard, no she won't draw a blank, no
Art and part, state of the art, it's time to roll it back, go
Suck it up, brush it off, break it down, here we go
Getting' back to that drawing board
Tear it up, scrub it off, take it down, gotta go
Get on back to that drawing board
Fold 'em up, shrug it off, whoa. Let it go
Rub it on, wet paint, war paint, get it
Pick it up, takin' too slow. Time to go
Hey yo, why aren't you ready?
One, two, three, four
She'll give you to the count of four, then
Four, three, two, one
She'll count back down then just for fun and
One, two, three, four, five, seven
Left our six, plus five's eleven
Wait now! Wait! What? Oh!
Time, out of time, now she's nursery rhymin'
Girls what're we made of? (yeah!)
Sugar, spice, and
Oooh, not what they're made of
We're everything
NICE! And if you're askin' my name (what!?)
I will tell you my name (what!?)
I'm Sugar Riot! Riot!
Pick them pieces up
Ring-a-roses
Palette full of pain and poison
On your toes, yeah
Keepin' you guessin'. What?
Ring-a-roses
Heart is skippin', mind is trippin'
Round and around and around, yo
Round and around and around until you're down
We all fall down
Round and round and round
We all fall down
Round and round and round
We all fall down
Round and round and
Ashes to ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes to DUST
