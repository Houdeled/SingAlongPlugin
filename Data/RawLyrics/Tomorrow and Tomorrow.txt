For whom weeps the storm
Her tears on our skin
The days of our years gone
Our souls soaked in sin
These memories ache with the weight of tomorrow
Who fights?
Who flies?
Who falls?
Stand tall, my friend
May all of the dark lost inside you find light again
In time tumbling, turning, we seek amends
Eternal winds to the land descend
Our journey will never end
From those who've fallen to those who rise
A prayer to keep us ever by your side
An undying promise that we just might carry on in a song
Pray don't forget us, your bygone kin
With one world's end does a new begin
And should our souls scatter unto the wind
Still, we shall live on
Stand tall, my friend
May all of the dark deep inside you find light again
This time, tumbling, turning, we make amends
Eternal winds from the land ascend
Here to lift us that we won't end
