Night.
Embrace Her worldly delights, tonight
In time you shall follow
In time you shall follow
Behold as our burdens come set with the sun
Tonight.
Step from the dark to the light, tonight
Rise high, high above our rivals
Spread our wings
Spread them wide
Let them guide
Hereby free to ever slumber
Open the door
Close our eyes
We are the dreamers
Fire.
Born of the flames of desire. This fire
Give in to the hunger
Give in to the hunger
Cast off inhibition, let passion run wild
Desire.
Fuel the unquenchable fire. Desire.
Rise high, high above your rivals
Spread your wings
Spread them wide
You needn't hide
Hereby free to ever slumber
Open the door
Close your eyes
You are the dreamer
