Tonight our city bleeds red, blue, and green
As I walk in the dark unseen
Yet like the grey the sky is draped in
The colors in my heart have faded
Gone
They're gone
They're gone
All gone
A girl looks to the stars and dares to dream
On the world she'd make her mark, it seemed
This phantom in my mirror starin' back
I realize that girl is
Gone
She's gone
She's gone
I'm gone
Climbed every mountain, made it to the top
I had it all, or so I thought
Traded tomorrow for a lie
And found the price too high
The clock is ticking counting down to naught
I'm outta time but it won't stop
I'll bet my life before it's lost
That final line I'll cross
There ain't no going back
No going back
No going back
No
What light's left here inside
I'll suffocate
If that's what it takes, oh
And those who look to cast me aside
or turn their backs and leave me to die
You can try, can try, come try,
But I will survive
No going back
No going back
Won't ever
(no) Never again, no
Ain't no going back
No going back
No coming back from the edge
Look in my eyes, yeah I know you understand
(somebody help, my misery's taking me)
I've made up my mind, now there ain't no going back
(somebody help, I'm losing what's left of me)
I've made up my mind, now my heart's demanding
I'm ready to fight til there's one left standing
Tonight, lightning'll strike, thunder will fall
(and) You're gonna give it all
To me
To me
To me
To me, I gotta believe
You'll set
Me free
Tonight my circle finally comes complete
One last step from the dark, I breathe
The music's swellin', crowd is chantin'
And for this moment fear's an after-
thought
It's gone
It's gone
All gone
I look out to the crowd and there I see
A thousand little girls--all me
I've turned the tables, yeah I'm fightin' back
I'll bring the lightnin', now it's
On
It's on
It's on
You're gone
Climbed every mountain, made it to the top
I had it all, or so I thought
Traded tomorrow for a lie
And found the price too high
The clock is ticking counting down to naught
I'm outta time but it won't stop
I'll bet my life before it's lost
That final line I'll cross
There ain't no going back
No going back
No going back
No
What light's left here inside
I'll suffocate
If that's what it takes, oh
And those who look to cast me aside
or turn their backs and leave me to die
You can try, can try, come try,
But I will survive
No going back
No going back
Won't ever
(no) Never again, no
Ain't no going back
No going back
No coming back from the edge, no more
