Titan!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
In hell I wait!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Succumb to the hate!
Into the dark of an endless night,
Where the pulse of the land offers no respite.
In spite of the blood that was spilled before,
You whet your blades, you thirst for more.
Now kneel overdweller, your lord commands,
Thereâ€™s no salvation for the sons of man.
The skies will tremble and the earth will quake,
From the crumbling walls no one escapes!
Bow down, overdweller!
Titan!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
In hell I wait!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Succumb to the hate! (Bow down, overdweller!)
(Titan!)
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
In hell I wait!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Under the weight!
Succumb to the hate!
