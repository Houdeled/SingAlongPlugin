Here on my throne, sits a pretender
(Traitorous! Not one of us!)
Hope in their hearts, the dawn in their eyes
(All lies! Foul lies!)
Left on my own, no I won't surrender
(Why am I suffering?)
Life won't play fair, why should I? 
Fury's fists and dirty razors
Fireballs and a hangman's noose
Crucified, I am the thorn in your side
Now cry as I dig in my hooks
Why should I buy the lies?
Compromise for what is rightfully mine?
On your knees, kiss the ring
'Cause I am your king
Tonight is the night
A blood moon is risin'
One spire left to climb
My pride's on the line, yeah
The fire 'neath the ice
The light that defines us
No price is too high
I'm not 'fraid of dying
(Not afraid! Not afraid!)
(No, I'm not afraid! NO!)
Hammerlock, cloverleaf
Crush the calf, spear, senton, and sweep
Flying avalanche, guillotine
Cobra clutch, hold, put 'em to sleep
Diving body drop, giant swing
Shoulder block, stomp, double the knee
Corner catapult, shatter machine
Suicide dive outta the ring. Pin 'em
You're going DOWN!
From dreams of dark, reborn, I awaken
(I'm alive! On fire!)
On failures past, I lie here and muse
(From the end! Rise again!)
Torn from my grasp, everything taken
(Empty heart! Empty hands!)
Now what have I left to lose?
Antitype, abomination
Anathema, yeah, torn in two
Cast aside, time to meet my maker
Testify what I think of Her rules
Light the match, feed the flame
Turn the torch on those who'd spit on my name
Bite down! Shut the **** up!
I'm going insane.
I've tried all my life
To break from this cycle
With one sacrifice
I'll conquer my rivals 
Tonight is the night
Put all this behind us
Won't run from the fight
I'm not 'fraid of dying
(Not afraid! Not afraid!)
(No, I'm not afraid! NO!)
Hammerlock, cloverleaf
Crush the calf, spear, senton, and sweep
Flying avalanche, guillotine
Cobra clutch, hold, put 'em to sleep
Diving body drop, giant swing
Shoulder block, stomp, double the knee
Corner catapult, shatter machine
Suicide dive outta the ring. Pin 'em
You're going DOWN!
