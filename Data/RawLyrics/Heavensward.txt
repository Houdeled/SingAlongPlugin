Beneath the gazing stars
Vales deep and forests dark
Betrayed by loyal hands, Her wrath stirred
Bound fast unto our fate
One path, one burden great
Yet ever do our aching souls point Heavensward
Ever rings out our song
Yes, ever do our aching souls march Heavensward
As they've done for so long
To their trespass
We are Witness
Here to pass this
Final sentence
No forgiveness
No deliverance
Only Justice
Only Vengeance
Wills unbending
Faith unending
Stone defending
Now our steel shall sing
Guide us, O mighty Fury
Guide us to victory!
Dys An Sohm In (Our slumber disturbed,)
Rohs An Kyn Ala na (All my brothers wake.)
Mah Morn Na-ah-ah-ahrr (The saviors must perish.)
Sahl Djahs Afah An (Vengeance will be ours.)
Eorzea!
