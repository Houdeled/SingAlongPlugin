A drifting tender
Come ride, heroes, ride
Her galleon severed
Away with the tide
The storm head gathers
Come ride, heroes, ride
Illusions scattered
Away with the tide
Time
Try, dare the dead, tread ahead on a road that is borrowed design
Through the sum of their sons do they seek tomorrow
Tonight, witness then as the end shall begin what was final
Their lies, folding back, further back, ever back to primal
A drifting tender
Come ride, heroes, ride
Her galleon severed
Away with the tide
The storm head gathers
Come ride, heroes, ride
Illusions scattered
Away with the tide
Time
Try, dare the dead, tread ahead on a road that is borrowed design
Through the sum of their sons do they seek tomorrow
Tonight, witness then as the end shall begin what was final
Their lies, folding back, further back, ever back to primal
