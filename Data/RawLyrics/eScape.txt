A drifting tender
Come ride, heroes, ride
Her galleon severed
Away with the tide
The stormheads gather
Come ride, heroes, ride
Illusions scattered
Away with the tide
Why
Do weathered warriors wander their way whither wanting wonders wait
Hark the heralds, anchors aweigh! Hither happens mine escape
Freedom forgone, sinking apace. Comets crumble, Phoebus fades
Under cosmic clamor decayed, hides a path untaken
Ancient echoes
Come ride, heroes, ride
In deafening silence
Away with the tide
A wave of hazard
Come ride, heroes, ride
A-whorling inward
Away with the tide
Time
Stellar stories starward bestrewn, slipping sidewise, see, they're snakes
Twixt the leaves you'll find naught amissâ€”missing aughts and crossing fates
Freedom surgent shifting ahead, comets dancing in her wake
To the cosmic clarion's accord, along the path not taken
Try, dare the dead tread ahead on a road that is borrowed
Design, through the sum of their sons do they seek tomorrow
Tonight, witness then as the end shall begin what was final
Their lies, folding back, further back, ever back to the primal
