Whispers falling silently drift on the wind
But I hear you
Our journey, now a memory fading from sight
But I see you
Unbroken promises we made so long ago
You're still here
Unspoken requiem for a river of tears
Flowing, winding, toward eternal sea
And yet our hope remains
Guiding, lighting the way
No time for mourning
rises on a land reborn from the ashes
'Neath the heavens
To sunset, blood-red skies tranquil after the storm
Blessed shadow
Turning, wending, always night follows day
The sun will shine again
Walk on, never look back
Through you, we live
Tales of loss and fire and faith
Every word on our hearts engraved
In the dark, you will not stray
Forge ahead till the end, we pray
Whispers falling silently drift on the wind
But I hear you
Our journey, now a memory fading from sight
But I see you
Unbroken promises we made so long ago
You're still here
Unspoken requiem for a river of tears
Flowing, winding, toward eternal sea
And yet our hope remains
Guiding, lighting the way
No time for mourning
rises on a land reborn from the ashes
'Neath the heavens
To sunset, blood-red skies tranquil after the storm
Blessed shadow
Turning, wending, always night follows day
The sun will shine again
Walk on, never look back
Through you, we live
Tales of loss and fire and faith
Every word on our hearts engraved
In the dark, you will not stray
Forge ahead till the end, we pray
