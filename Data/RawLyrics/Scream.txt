Foul child, bastard and beast
O lost lamb, first to the feast
Come claim if you're able
A spot at this table
Mild and meek, down on your knees
For hide and seek. It's time that we feed
Your heart is racing, blood is running cold
Your fractured will is whispering (fly away, fly away)
Far Away
Here be lions
Say goodnight
With each bite does your sanity die
Sucking the life out, letting the dark
Inside
Say a prayer as the light leaves your eyes
Or scream all you like, your gods can't hear you
Scream
Now Scream
Scream
Pseudo suicide, don't choke on your pride
Scream
Now scream
Now. Scream.
Yeah, I'm gonna watch you bleed
Flensed and flayed, how does it feel?
Your pound is paid, those scars will not heal, no
Lost in suffering, drowning in your tears
Won't someone, somewhere tell me (where do I, where do I)
Go from here
Be the lion
Say goodnight
With each bite does your sanity die
Sucking the life out, letting the dark
Inside
Say a prayer as the light leaves your eyes
Or scream all you like, the gods can't hear you
Dressed in rage
Inside my cage
My pandemonium
Still bound to the flame that I bear
Buried alive
In the coffin of who I used to be
I'll scream all I like, 'cause we're all mad here
(Slumbering, tumbling)
(Wandering, wondering)
(Suffering, hungering)
Forever falling into my mind
Deeper, deeper down 'til I
Say goodnight
To the shadow I left far behind
I'm just a stranger, we are all strange
Inside
You can run but there's nowhere to hide
So scream all you like, no one can hear us
Follow me (Follow me)
Come follow me (Follow me)
To Pandemonium
Still bound to the flame that I bear (There's)
No release (Rescue me)
From this empty, waking wonderland (Rescue me)
So scream if you like, 'cause we're all mad here
Scream all you like, 'cause we're all mad here
