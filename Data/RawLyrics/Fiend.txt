What is it like when you pull back the curtain
And realize every wrong is a right?
Your world is rusted like a dirty razor
The edge is calling tonight
The edge is calling tonight
The edge is calling tonight
The sun is setting, darkness taking over
A date with chaos and you're dressed to the nines
Salt of the earth salting your own fields
Road to destruction that is true and tried
You walk the path laid before you
The call of reason, you refuse to abide
Necessity is an inventive mother
Promising sanctum that She cannot provide
She is the hand that rocks the cradle
The wind that breaks the bough and leaves you to die
And there She leaves you to die
And there She leaves you to die
You'll find slumber when the world comes tumbling down
Sweet dreams, baby. Sleep tight!
Retreat where lesser men lead
Flee from what you do not see
Heed the dark within your being
Turn away
Disobey
I'm the end and the beginning
The faith that feeds the unbelieving
A tightening knot to staunch the bleeding
Say my name
Say my name
Sephirot!
The seventh hell's become your seventh heaven
Rose of redemption but a thorn in your pride
Waste no more time fighting your demons
Lay down your arms and let the evil inside
And then you let it inside
And then you let it inside
You let it eat you till there's nothing left at all
So you can feel that you are truly alive
Better to serve in a waking nightmare
Than rule in their paradise
What is gold, always glitters
But it still comes with an unpayable price
Treading out upon the stagnant waters
Our savior waiting for a turn in the tide
You are the night at the end of the tunnel
The empty void where the serpent lies
Where the serpent lies
Where the serpent lies
The angels graze in the meadows of excess
They must needs go that the devils drive
Retreat where lesser men lead
Flee from what you do not see
Concede your mind unto the fiend
Turn away
Debts are paid
I'm the end and the beginning
The drug that gives the wretched meaning
The answer every soul is seeking
Say my name
Say my name
Sephirot!
