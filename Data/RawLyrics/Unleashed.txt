In my thirst for battle,
there I see it — sets my heart to racing
In my thirst for battle,
there I feel it — sets my soul to blazing
Sweet, tender smiles on every empty face
(Someday soon my will is bound to break)
Serene surrounds to keep them safe
(All blind to the cage closing)
Maybe I'll join them and shut my eyes
(How long can I stand to stay my blade?)
But how could my pride dare abide?
(I can feel my rage growing)
They call this a city, but that’s not what I see
We’re locked in a cell with no key
(I can feel the walls are closing in)
They’ve clouded my vision, I’m robbed of decisions
With nowhere to go, there’s one thing I know
When I climb in the ring
we lock eyes — that’s when I realize
That I’m free. This is me.
This is who I was meant to be.
Bare my claws, bare my fangs,
my heart’s racing — it’s the thrill of the fight
As I run and I howl at the moon (I know)
I’ve the strength to defeat any foe (I see)
There is nowhere that I cannot go (face me)
Come prepared if you dare, but you’ll ne— (ver bring me down)
In my thirst for battle,
there I see it — sets my heart to racing
In my thirst for battle,
there I feel it — sets my soul to blazing
In my thirst for battle,
there I see it — sets my heart to racing
In my thirst for battle,
there I feel it — sets my soul to blazing
Inside the cage, you have to know your place
(Everybody tells me who I am)
Dull, dreary lives with no escape
(Held down by their false choices)
It may be easy to trust their lies
(Why should I deny all that I am?)
But soon you’ll be empty inside
(Can’t give in to those voices)
They judge and they hate me,
but they’ll never break me
I’ll never stop longing to be free
(Searching for a place where I belong)
They’ve clouded my vision,
I’m robbed of decisions
With nowhere to go,
there’s one thing I know
When I climb in the ring
we lock eyes — that’s when I realize
That I’m free. This is me.
This is who I was meant to be.
Bare my claws, bare my fangs,
my heart’s racing — it’s the thrill of the fight
As I run and I howl at the moon (I know)
I’ve the strength to defeat any foe (I see)
There is nowhere that I cannot go (face me)
Come prepared if you dare, but you’ll ne— (ver bring me down)
I’m free!
The beast has been unleashed, so
Come prepared (come prepared) if you dare (if you dare)
I’ll bring all to bear — I swear —
to bring you down!
