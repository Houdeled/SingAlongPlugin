One brings shadow, one brings light
Two-toned echoes tumbling through time
Threescore wasted, ten cast aside
Four-fold knowing, no end in sight
One brings shadow, one brings light
Two-toned echoes tumbling through time
Threescore wasted, ten cast aside
Four-fold knowing, no end in sight
All our splendour bathed black in silence
Our surrender a sombre reverie
Slowly drifting down into twilight
Left to sifting through faded memories
Know our places, for worth is wordless
Evanescent, this writing on the wall
Brother stay this descent to madness
Come and save us. Catch us before we fall
Riding home
Riding home
Finding hope
Don't lose hope
Like broken angels, wingless, cast from heavens' gates
(Our slumb'ring demons awake)
We only fly when falling, falling far from grace
(Hell take us, heaven can wait)
Our lives a message in a bottle cast to sea
(Disgrace untold and unseen)
Quick to their ends, our candles burn until we're free
In monochrome melodies
Our tears are painted in red
(Bleeding to the edge)
Deep inside we're nothing more
Than scions and sinners
In the rain
Do light and darkness fade
Yes, time circles endlessly
The hands of fate trained ahead
(Pointing to the edge)
All things change, drawn to the flame
To rise from the ashes.
To begin
We first must see the end
One brings shadow, one brings light
Two-toned echoes tumbling through time
Threescore wasted, ten cast aside
Four-fold knowing, no end in sight
One brings shadow, one brings light
Two-toned echoes tumbling through time
Threescore wasted, ten cast aside
Four-fold knowing, no end in sight
Rock of ages, we cast the first stone
In our cages, we know not what we do
Indecision here at the crossroads
Recognition, tomorrow's come too soon
Follow blindly like lambs to slaughter
At the mercy of those who ply the sword
As our song wends dead underwater
We're forgotten for now and evermore
Riding home
Riding home
Finding hope
Don't lose hope
Without a compass wand'ring lost in lies of faith
(Faith slowly wasting away)
Only alive in fighting Death's amber embrace
(Our hearts beat loud, unafraid)
On Hands and knees we pray to gods we've never seen
(Come shadow, come follow me)
The final hour upon us, no more time to breathe
In monochrome melodies
Our tears are painted in red
(Bleeding to the edge)
Deep inside we're nothing more
Than scions and sinners
In the rain
Do light and darkness fade
Yes, time circles endlessly
The hands of fate trained ahead
(Pointing to the edge)
All things change, drawn to the flame
To rise from the ashes.
To begin
We first must see the end
